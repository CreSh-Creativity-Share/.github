# AI analysis

At Cresh, we believe in the power of humans and AI working together, so we have natively integrated our solution with the artificial brain. Each idea that is posted on Cresh is supported by an analysis of the potential for commercial success.

## Meaning of rating

We decided to present the results of our complex analysis in the form of a school evaluation. An idea can receive a grade from A to F. Please keep in mind that this is a subjective analysis generated using AI algorithms and may not be objective.

Meaning of the grade:
 * S - top idea highly recommended to development,
 * A - recommended for development,
 * B - may go forward, but need to collect more data,
 * C - recommended to go forward, returns likely modest,
 * D - doubtful, further development not recommended,
 * F - strongly recommend to stop further development.

Evaluation depends on the obtained values of the analysis metrics. You can find the exact list of obtained metrics below.

## Analysis generation

There is no need to specially create an analysis. The moment you add an idea, the creation of the analysis is triggered. It usually does not take more than 5 minutes. Add an idea, make yourself a cup of coffee or tea and start enjoying the finished analysis.

As you create your analysis, you will see a spinning wheel at the bottom of the detailed idea view.

## Rating scale

The idea is evaluated in 34 aspects on a scale of 1 to 5, where the values correspond sequentially:
 * (1) indicates a very negative feature,
 * (2) indicates a negative feature,
 * (3) indicates a neutral feature,
 * (4) indicates a positive feature,
 * (5) indicates a very positive feature.

## Meaning of percents

The maximum average rating of an idea is 5. We decided to show the result of the analysis in percentage terms, as a percentage of the average rating of an idea divided by the maximum rating, which is 5.

percent = Average rating / 5

## Quick View

The rating is displayed for each idea on the wall and in its detail view as a percentage of the total. You can find it above the title.

## Overall view

To better understand the intricate metrics, we decided to divide them into 5 categories that display as an easy-to-understand chart. This can be found in the idea detail view under the "Idea Scoring Components" tab.

The values of each category are an average of its components.

We have prepared the following groups

| Metric shortcut  | Metric full name  |
|---|---|
| TVG  | Technical Viability Group  |
| MVG  | Market Viability Group  |
| PVG  | Product Viability Group  |
| MSG  | Market Strategy Group  |
| RFVG  | Risk and Financial Viability Group  |

## Detail view

However, we see the greatest value in the detailed view, which includes explanations of the ratings given and suggestions related to them. Everything is presented in charts that allow intuitive evaluation of the idea.
